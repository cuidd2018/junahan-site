I want to thank the President-elect for joining the ex-Presidents for lunch. And one message that I have and I think we all share is that we want you to succeed. Whether we're Democrat or Republican, we care deeply about this country. 

And to the extent we can, we look forward to sharing our experiences with you. All of us who have served in this office understand that the office transcends the individual. 

And we wish you all the very best. And so does the country. 

PRESIDENT-ELECT OBAMA: Thank you.
